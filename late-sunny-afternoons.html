            <h2> LATE SUNNY AFTERNOONS </h2>
        <p> afternoon aching paired with a <br> 
            new found addiction to burning cinnamon incense until <br>
            clouds seep their way over the mountain tops <br>
            shadows crossing, cascading slowly on these beige walls <br>
            of which I despise so dearly <br> 
            but have yet to paint over in my years of residency <br> <br> 

            their mellow tone seems to have grown on me <br>
            perhaps even shown me a little sense in the fact that <br>
            not everything needs to be stark white and sterile <br>
            for that, at least, I appreciate their faded embrace <br>
            hugging me as the tendrils of smoke dance their way upwards, <br>
            my consciousness with them, <br>
            journeying beyond this self proclaimed box <br> <br>

            to be in this warmth alone is not comforting, <br> 
            but instead comfortable <br> 
            which, if you think about it <br>
            makes perfect sense <br> 
                              and yet none at all <br> <br>

            as do many afternoons spent drifting around these worn into sheets, <br> 
            soft in their nature <br>
            brought back by the people who lay beneath them, beneath each other <br> <br>

            my, the feeling of being underneath you is so nice I wonder sometimes <br> 
            it might be better to melt into one being <br>
            to which perhaps, I think, <br>
            we may have already done so <br> <br>

            but although you fit so nicely in tangled puzzles with me, I am at ease with myself <br> <br>

            it is simply the fact that all I choose to be grows tenfold with you <br> 
            and that my dearest is why think so fondly of you on these late, <br>
                                                                    sunny afternoons
