            <h2> ANTS </h2>
            <p> Latch onto me, <br>
                Grapple my waist and remind me <br> 
                Of what it took, to get to this place <br>
                How the grind of my bones felt <br> <br>

                On this pavement I followed so religiously <br>
                But I was never religious, you see <br>
                Bound to this conscious tumour <br>
                So wicked and unforgiving <br> <br>

                Watch me claw at the faucets <br>
                Beg for my life back <br>
                Forgive me, forget me <br>
                Is this meant to be winning? <br> <br>

                Why does my body crawl with fire <br>
                Ants dancing through my bloodstream <br>
                Dispersing into fingertips gone numb <br>
                Did you think I was done? This is just the beginning <br> <br>

                Wouldn’t have guessed I’d turn out like this <br>
                So don’t question my screaming <br>
                This language so foreign, hissing on my tongue <br>
                Yet I sit, unbelievably still in the chaos <br> <br>

                Thinking this way is a customary sin <br>
                Reality gone blurry to the craving <br>
                Weathered with time I’ve stopped squinting <br>
                Scraping at my insides for an answer <br> <br>

                Pouring my insecurities, past tendencies <br>
                Spitting from my mouth, gagging common sense <br>
                Scouring my taste buds into submission <br>
                Preparation for a road to death’s bed <br> <br>

                Watching the ants roll by in waves <br>
                Their slick, oil like demeanor a welcomed escape <br>
                Rolling back my neck, lull of an eye <br>
                Let them consume me, use me <br> <br>


                Am I really that insane <br> <br>

                                     or is it the ants talking? <br>
